The Morea team is delighted to announce the release of Version 3.2.  This release focuses on improved support for new Morea users, and includes:

* Addition of a "template-module" to the morea template repository.
* Documentation explaining module design and implementation using the new template-module. For details, see [Module design](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/instructors/module-design).
* Addition of a "_module-icons" directory to the morea template repository, making over 50 PNG from past Morea modules available. For details, see [Module Icons documentation](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/instructors/icons#module-icons).
* Documentation on how to use Gitpod for Morea development. For details, see [Choosing local vs. cloud development](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/instructors/quick-start#choose-local-or-cloud-development)
* Bundler updated to 2.4.2, various gems updated.

As usual, any changes to the code do not impact existing sites.  You will only see these changes the next time you create a new Morea site from the [morea template repository](https://github.com/morea-framework/morea).

Have fun and let us know if you run into problems.
