title:  "Non-Morea markdown files"
---

The Morea generator now allows you to create markdown files inside the `morea/` directory with the extension `.markdown`.
These files are processed into HTML by Jekyll, but will not appear as a module, outcome, reading, experience, or assessment. This is useful for creating (for example) quizzes in markdown format that are kept with other module files. 

For more details, see the non-morea markdown section of the user guide.

To obtain this update, run the `morea-merge-upstream.sh` script.
