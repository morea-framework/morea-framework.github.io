The Morea team is delighted to announce the release of Version 3.1.  This release adds a number of useful new features to Morea, including:

* Update of Bootstrap to 5.1.3.  This enables style customization using [Bootstrap CSS Variables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/css-variables/).

* Morea 3.1 sites now load [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). This makes a gazillion icons available. For documentation, see the [Morea User Guide Chapter on Icons](/docs/instructors/icons).

* You can now easily create "Admonitions" or "Callouts". See the [Morea User Guide Chapter on Admonitions](/docs/instructors/admonitions) for details.

* Morea 3.1 sites now load [Anchor.js](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/). This provides deep linking into sections of pages. 

Many users might decide to wait to obtain these features until the next time they create a Morea site. If you want to upgrade an existing site to Version 3.1, then we provide guidance in the [Morea User Guide Chapter on Updating](/docs/instructors/updating).

Have fun and let us know if you run into problems.
