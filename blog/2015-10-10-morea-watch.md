The Morea team is delighted to announce the release of morea-watch.rb, a ruby script you can use instead of morea-run-local.sh and which will automatically stop and restart morea-run-local.sh whenever files in the morea directory change.

Morea-watch.rb was developed by Dan Port. Please check it out and let us know what you think!
