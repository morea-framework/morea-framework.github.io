This chapter provides documentation concerning the design and implementation of workshops that are hosted at the [Change-HI/EDU](https://change-hi.github.io) Morea site. 

The Change-HI program, in partnership with the University of Hawaii Data Science Institute (HI-DSI),sponsors a set of two hour workshops, which introduce participants to a particular technology or skill that can prove helpful to their research or professional practice. These workshops are also intended as a mechanism for students to learn educational skills as they develop and deliver the workshops to participants. 

The following sections in this chapter provide information on:

* How do you get started with workshop development? What are the mechanics of cloning, updating, and merging the Change-HI/EDU github repo with a new (or improved) workshop module?
* How do you design and implement a high quality workshop? How do you create a high quality workshop? How does a workshop differ from a seminar or a class?
* What are tips and strategies for the nuts and bolts of workshop implementation with Morea?
* How can Change-HI administrators make edits to the live site?
