The Morea framework derives its functionality from a combination of three technologies:

  1. **GitHub and git:**  this technology allows sophisticated collaboration (through branching, forking, and pull requests),evolution (by cloning of the prior semester's repository when starting a new semester), access control (through private repos with public gh-pages branches), website hosting, and cloud-based content storage.

  2. **Jekyll:** this technology makes it possible to cleanly separate content (i.e. markdown) from presentation (i.e. the website and its associated HTML, CSS, and Javascript). It is possible for Morea users to create entire courses without writing any HTML.

  3. **Morea plugin and files:** By far the most minor of the three technologies, the Morea plugin allows users to create content (such as an Outcome) with an associated ID and refer to it in multiple places (such as in multiple modules.) In addition, the Morea plugin allows users to create content (such as an Outcome) and have it be presented in multiple pages (such as in its associated modules, associated assessments, and in the Outcomes page).

For more information on GitHub, Git, or Jekyll, consult their project sites.  This page provides a brief orientation to the design of the Morea-specific code.
