Welcome to the Instructor Guide for the Morea Framework.

This chapter provides an overview of the concepts underlying Morea as well as practical guidance for constructing a website.

The Getting Started section dives right in with instructions on how to create and publish a course site. You'll also learn what tools must be installed on your computer to support Morea course development, and then we'll step through some simple edits to the default Morea content provided in every new site.

The Reference section provides details on the design of Morea sites and how to make best use of the framework.

Please consult the [Help Page](/docs/help) if you need support or encounter errors using Morea.
