Welcome to the Instructor Guide for the Morea Framework.

This chapter provides an overview of the concepts underlying Morea as well as practical guidance for constructing a website.


The next section dives right in with instructions on how to create and publish a course site. You'll next learn what tools must be installed on your computer to support Morea course development, and then we'll step through some simple edits to the default Morea content provided in every new site.

After these introductory sections, we'll step back to describe the pedagogy and its implementation in more detail. The remainder of this chapter presents design and implementation features in detail.
