All Morea sites automatically load the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon set. You can follow their [How To](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/add-icons/how-to) to learn how to use icons.

Here is a simple example:

```css
<i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>
```

Learn about how to style icons with [Styling with Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/styling).

You can see an example Morea page containing a Font Awesome icon at: https://morea-framework.github.io/morea/morea/example-introduction/example-icon.html
