Another way to understand Morea is by contrasting it with other tools used by educators to create course content.

## GitBook

[GitBook](http://www.gitbook.io/), like Morea, creates educational websites using Markdown and Git.  If you want to
write a textbook, GitBook is a better choice.  Morea is preferred when you want to create a course curriculum from
a variety of sources including your own and/or other sources, and when you want to make learning objectives and
assessments explicit.

## Learning Management Systems

[Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/) is one instance of an "enterprise learning management system (LMS)" that provides comprehensive support for all
aspects of course management: content management, testing, grading, etc. (Others include [eFront](http://www.efrontlearning.net/), [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), [Ilias](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=st_229_35&client_id=docu), [Dokeos](http://www.dokeos.com/), [Sakai](http://www.sakaiproject.org/),
[Claroline](http://www.claroline.net/), [Atutor](http://www.atutor.ca/), and [Olat](http://www.olat.org/)).
Morea provides a small subset of the capabilities of these systems, but is oriented toward the needs of institutions
rather than individual teachers.

## Metacademy

[Metacademy](http://www.metacademy.org/) is a site for community curated educational content.  Unlike Morea,
Metacademy supports a single version of curriculum material for any given topic.  In contrast, Morea tries to make it
as easy as possible for each educator to have their own, slightly (or radically) different version of curriculum
material for any given topic.  It's much like the difference between centralized version control (i.e. SVN) where there is
always a single "golden" version of a system, and distributed version control (i.e. git) where there can be many "different
but equal" versions of a system.

## Laulima

[Laulima](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/lum/fp/login.php) is a custom LMS for the University of Hawaii based on [Sakai](http://www.sakaiproject.org/).  Laulima does not implement the MOREA Pedagogical Pattern and so there is no ability to manipulate Modules, Readings, and so forth as "first class entities".  This makes it difficult to (for example) support "Prerequisite Modules". In addition, Laulima implements a "pay wall", making content difficult to access or discover. Finally, the use of WYSIWYG editors makes it more difficult to reuse or export course content.  That said, Laulima does provide useful support for grading and assignment management.  In practice, users of Morea at the University of Hawaii typically use both tools: Morea for course content, and Laulima for assignment and course grading.
