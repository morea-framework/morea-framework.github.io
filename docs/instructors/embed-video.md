YouTube videos are easy to embed into Readings or other Morea pages. 

The includes directory provides a file called youtube.html that provides the boilerplate code for embedding a youtube video.  You can use it to embed a YouTube video like this:

```
{% include youtube.html id="WEpHzPPCKJE" %}
```

If you need to include videos from other sources (such as Vimeo), you can write your own custom include file, using youtube.html as a basis.
