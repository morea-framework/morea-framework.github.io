This section of the site provides documentation concerning the use of Morea for the [University of Hawaii CyberInsfrastructure TRaining to Advance Climate Science (CI-TRACS)](https://ci-tracs.github.io) program. 

The CI-TRACS program sponsors a set of workshops, which are generally two hours in length and that introduce participants to a particular technology or skill that can prove helpful to their research or professional practice.  

Previously, CI-TRACS workshops were developed using Software Carpentry. Some of the potential benefits for using Morea for CI-TRACS include:

* Morea implements a single "point of entry" where each workshop is represented as a module. This makes it easy to: represent (and inter-relate) all of the workshops; browse all of the workshops; and show relationships between workshops.  The Software Carpentry approach results in entirely independent sites for each workshop, so the "point of entry" is the [CI-TRACS github organization home page](https://github.com/CI-TRACS), which is not particularly user friendly.

* Morea implements a [pedagogical pattern](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/instructors/pedagogical-pattern) (Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, Assessments). This pattern helps instructors represent workshops in a consistent manner, and helps them to assess whether or not they are missing useful pedagogical elements (for example, Assessments seems to be lacking in most of the Workshops).  In addition to helping instructors structure their workshops consistently and completely, it is possible in Morea to share elements across multiple modules.  For example, the "CI-TRACS Code of Conduct" reading is defined once, and then included as a reading in all workshops. Similarly, the "Python and Jupyter" module is a prerequisite for multiple workshops.

* Unlike Software Carpentry, Morea is not designed specifically for workshops. This makes it easier to expand CI-TRACS to support other kinds of educational activities.

* Morea makes it easy to provide useful non-workshop material as a separate module. For example, the  "Introduction" module provides background material on the CI-TRACS program and information on how to get involved.
