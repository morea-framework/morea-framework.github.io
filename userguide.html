     <h1>Pedagogical Pattern</h1>

<p>Morea implements a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogical_patterns">pedagogical pattern</a> along with a combination of technologies (git, GitHub, Jekyll) that facilitiate development, maintenance, and collaboration. Here are some of the key features of the pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Morea defines five &quot;entity types&quot;: module, outcome, reading, experience, and assessment.</strong></p>

<p>A <em>module</em> is a container that holds a set of outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments related to course content. Modules have a sort order, which allows you to organize modules into a sequence. Most courses consist of 6 to 30+ modules.  A module can contain zero to many instances of outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments. It is possible to define a module without zero outcomes, zero readings, zero experiences, and zero assessments, though we&#39;re not sure of the utility of such a module.</p>

<p>An <em>outcome</em> represents some kind of knowledge or capability that the student should acquire as a result of the readings and experiences in the associated module.  A module can have multiple outcomes.  Conversely, the same outcome can be associated with multiple modules. We find that a useful way to organize and express learning outcomes is through <a href="http://www.utar.edu.my/fegt/file/Revised_Blooms_Info.pdf">Bloom&#39;s revised taxonomy</a>, which classifies outcomes into six categories: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. The latter outcomes (analyzing, evaluating, and creating) are supposed to represent &quot;high-order&quot; cognitive skills.</p>

<p>A <em>reading</em> is an artifact that the student studies: it represents &quot;passive&quot; learning. Readings are typically chapters in a book, online web pages, and so forth.</p>

<p>In contrast to a reading, an <em>experience</em> represents a more &quot;active&quot; form of learning in which the student solves problems or performs other activities in order to acquire understanding and capability. Morea distinguishes between readings and experiences because modules that contain only readings without experiences will tend to have outcomes associated with lower levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, while modules containing a mixture of readings and experiences are more likely to support outcomes at higher levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy.</p>

<p>An <em>assessment</em> is an activity that evaluates the success of the student in achieving the educational goals of the module.  In the best case, the educational goals of the module are adequately expressed by learning outcomes, in which case each assessment should relate to one or more outcomes.  The graphic <a href="images/Stobaugh_BloomsTaxonomy.png">Applying Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy in your Classroom</a> provides various examples of how outcomes and assessments can be linked together.  While Morea can help make linkages between outcomes and assessments clear, it is common to assess skills not encapsulated by outcomes, or desire outcomes that are not assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Morea generates five &quot;views&quot; of the content, each organized according to an entity.</strong></p>

<p>Morea sites contain a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to pages that organize the content according to each of the five entities: modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments. For example, here is an example of the Readings page:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-readings.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>And here is an example of the Outcomes page:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-outcomes.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>You can see that the two pages highlight a single entity type but provide links to other entities for context.</p>

<p>We believe that presenting the content organized according to different entity types makes it easier for students and educators to understand the conceptual structure of the course.   For educators, it also provides a useful way to see if the course is structurally coherent. For example, when the learning objectives are examined together, do they create a coherent set?   For another example, are there assessments for each module, and if not, is that appropriate?</p>

<p><strong>Every Morea entity has its own markdown file.</strong></p>

<p>Every instance of a Morea entity (module, outcome, reading, experience, assessment) is represented by a single markdown file. There can also be other markdown files and other non-markdown files (such as the logo image file associated with each module).</p>

<p><strong>All of your course content is located in the src/morea/ directory.</strong></p>

<p>When you first clone a Morea site, you will find a potentially bewildering number of files and directories. For example:</p>

<p><img src="images/morea-source.png" width="200px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>This organization exists because the Morea framework is basically just a Jekyll site with a custom plugin to process the Morea markdown files.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the only files you will typically need to manage are all located in the src/morea directory. Here is an example of the src/morea directory from the basic-template system:</p>

<p><img src="images/morea-folder.png" width="200px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>This folder contains all of the files you will want to manage as part of your course content.</p>

<p><strong>You can organize the src/morea/ directory any way you like.</strong></p>

<p>The Morea framework does not care how you organize the files within the src/morea directory. For example, you can place all of your files at the top level of this directory. Alternatively, and more typically, you can create subdirectories within the src/morea directory, one per module, as shown in the previous screenshot.</p>

<p><strong>Morea makes a &quot;mirror image&quot; of the src/morea directory in the published HTML site.</strong></p>

<p>Because we want you to provide course content in the src/morea directory, and because course content can include (for example) image files, Morea creates a kind of &quot;mirror image&quot; of the src/morea directory in the published site so that your content can include links within itself as well as to external sites.</p>

<p>The basic rule is that markdown files are converted to HTML in the published site, and all other files get copied over without change. So, for example, here is the src/morea directory (on the left) and the site&#39;s published morea directory (on the right):</p>

<p><img src="images/mirror-image.png" width="400px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>As you can see, the markdown files have become HTML, and the sole non-markdown file (logo.png) has been copied over unchanged.  The directory structure below the morea/ directory is unchanged.</p>

<h1>Related systems</h1>

<p>Another way to understand Morea is by contrasting it with other tools used by educators to create course content.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gitbook.io/">GitBook</a>, like Morea, creates educational websites using Markdown and Git.  If you want to
write a textbook, GitBook is a better choice.  Morea is preferred when you want to create a course curriculum from
a variety of sources including your own and/or other sources, and when you want to make learning objectives and
assessments explicit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a> is one instance of an &quot;enterprise learning management system (LMS)&quot; that provides comprehensive support for all
aspects of course management: content management, testing, grading, etc. (Others include <a href="http://www.efrontlearning.net/">eFront</a>, <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>, <a href="http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=st_229_35&amp;client_id=docu">Ilias</a>, <a href="http://www.dokeos.com/">Dokeos</a>, <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</a>, 
<a href="http://www.claroline.net/">Claroline</a>, <a href="http://www.atutor.ca/">Atutor</a>, and <a href="http://www.olat.org/">Olat</a>).<br>
Morea provides a small subset of the capabilities of these systems, but is oriented toward the needs of institutions
rather than individual teachers. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.metacademy.org/">Metacademy</a> is a site for community curated educational content.  Unlike Morea,
Metacademy supports a single version of curriculum material for any given topic.  In contrast, Morea tries to make it
as easy as possible for each educator to have their own, slightly (or radically) different version of curriculum
material for any given topic.  It&#39;s much like the difference between centralized version control (i.e. SVN) where there is
always a single &quot;golden&quot; version of a system, and distributed version control (i.e. git) where there can be many &quot;different
but equal&quot; versions of a system.</p>

<p>If you know of a related system, please let us know and we&#39;ll include it here.</p>

<h1>Anatomy of a Module</h1>

<p>This section overviews the structure of the module <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/basic-template/tree/master/src/morea/foo">Foo</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/basic-template">basic-template</a> system.  Here is a
graphic to help illustrate the various components:</p>

<p><img src="images/module-anatomy.jpg" width="800px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>The top row illustrates various &quot;source&quot; files, and the bottom row illustrates various &quot;output&quot; HTML pages
produced from these files.</p>

<p>The top right window shows the contents of the src/morea/foo directory. This directory defines
the content associated with the Foo module.  Note that the directory contains two files that are
not associated with the Foo module.  This is unusual but permissible in Morea.</p>

<p>The second window on the top row shows the content of module.md.  The content of this file is mostly Front Matter,
and provides the definition of the Foo module.  The outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments associated with
the Foo module are all referenced by unique IDs.</p>

<p>The third and fourth windows on the top row show the content of two files that define a reading and an experience entity.These entities have unique IDs that are referenced in the definition of the Foo module, and that is the way that Morea connects them together.</p>

<p>The bottom row shows a variety of pages produced by Morea.  Because a module was defined in the module.md file, it
will show up in the modules/ page.  Clicking on the link in the modules page takes you to a page which details the
contents of that module. As you can see, the content associated with each of the unique IDs referenced in the module.md file shows up in this
page.  The other pages illustrate the content (such as a Reading) will not only appear in the module (or modules) with
which it is associated, but also in the Readings page.</p>

<p>In summary, Morea markdown files create a set of entities, each of which are identified by a unique ID.  The
contents of a module (outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments) are specified by providing unique IDs. The
relationship between modules and its content entities is many-to-many. First, a module can refer to multiple outcomes,
readings, experiences, and assessments. Conversely, any given outcome, reading, experiences, and assessment can
appear in multiple modules.</p>

<h1>Morea entity types</h1>

<p>This section documents the structure and behavior of the five Morea entity types.</p>

<h3>Module</h3>

<p>Modules are represented by a markdown file where the Front Matter defines the structure of the module
and the body of the file (typically a sentence or two) summarizes the module contents.</p>

<p><strong>Sample module markdown file contents</strong></p>

<p><strong>Outcome body text</strong></p>

<p>In an outcome definition, the text following the Front Matter describes
 the outcome. This text appears both in all of the Module pages referring to this outcome,
 as well as on the Outcomes page.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>Each reading represents a &quot;passive&quot; learning opportunity associated with the module.
There are two types of readings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Readings in which the material is &quot;inline&quot;, as the body text associated with the file.</li>
<li>Readings in which the material is &quot;online&quot;, and the Front Matter provides a link to that material.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether or not the reading is &quot;inline&quot; or &quot;online&quot; depends upon whether the keyword morea_url appears
in the Front Matter.   Here are examples of each:</p>

<p><strong>Sample &quot;inline&quot; reading markdown file contents</strong></p>

## Asymptotic Concepts

#### 5 points

**1\. (1 pt)** We can extend asymptotic notation to the case of two parameters n and m that can go to infinity independently at different rates. For example, we denote by O(g(n,m)) the set of functions:

&gt; O(_g_(_n_,_m_)) = {_f_(_n_,_m_) : there exists positive constants _c_, _n_0
and _m_0 such that 0 ≤ _f_(_n_,_m_) ≤ _c__g_(_n_,_m_) for all _n_ ≥ _ _n0 or
_m_ ≥ _m_0}

Give a corresponding definition for Θ(_g_(_n_,_m_)).

<p><strong>Experience body text</strong></p>

<p>The body text should describe the experience in markdown format.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Each assessment represents the results of some activity intended to determine whether or not the students
have acquired the knowledge and/or capabilities intended by the module&#39;s readings and experiences.</p>

<p>Assessments appear as the body text of the file, typically as charts. We recommend that
you publish the assessment results in a manner that preserves student anonymity.</p>

<p>For each assessment, you can provide a list of outcomes that the assessment checked. This list
 of outcomes will be listed with the assessment, and the assessment will appear with the outcome.</p>

<p>Publishing assessment results has a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Students get a sense for both how they are performing relative to others during the course.</li>
<li>Students understand how the educator is attempting to assess the learning associated with the module.</li>
<li>Assessment results become part of the &quot;public record&quot; associated with the module, facilitating future
modification and improvement of the assessment technique.</li>
</ul>

<p>To present assessment results as charts, you can include Javascript directly in the markdown file, as illustrated in the following example:</p>

<p><strong>Sample assessment markdown file contents</strong></p>

<h3>Prerequisite</h3>

<p>As of Morea 2.0, it is possible to define <em>Prerequisite</em> modules, or modules from another Morea site whose material should be mastered prior to starting this module.</p>

<p>The following image illustrates the top part of a Module definition page specifying three prerequisite modules from three prior courses:</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid gray" src="images/morea-2.0/prerequisite-modules.png" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p>As with all other &quot;tiles&quot; in Morea sites, these can be clicked to go to the corresponding module from the external site.</p>

<p>There are two steps to using Prerequisite modules. First, you must define them, and second, you must reference them in another module as a Prerequisite.</p>

<p><strong>Prequisite body text</strong></p>

<p>The body text should describe the prerequisite in markdown format. It will appear in the tile, so should be relatively concise.</p>

<h1>Content development</h1>

<p>The material in this section assumes that you have set up your local environment according to
the instructions in the <a href="/quickstart.html">QuickStart page</a>.</p>

<h2>Develop by duplicating modules</h2>

<p>Development of curriculum content seems to be easiest by organizing module material by
directories. Then, to create a new module, just:</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplicate an existing module directory using your operating system commands.</li>
<li>Edit the module definition markdown file.  Define a new unique ID for that module, and change
the references to outcome IDs, reading IDs, experience IDs, and assessment IDs appropriately.</li>
<li>Edit the markdown files within the new directory files to define the outcomes, readings,
experiences, and assessments associated with the new module.</li>
<li>Check to make sure the new module displays correctly in your local browser and that the sort order
numbers result in the correct ordering on all pages.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Edit&gt;Compile&gt;Review&gt;Publish</h2>

<p>Development of course content with Morea follows this general sequence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit: Modify the files in the morea/ directory.</li>
<li>Compile: Invoke the &quot;Morea compiler&quot; (i.e. jekyll) using the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/scripts/blob/master/morea-run-local.sh">morea-run-local.sh</a> script</li>
<li>Review: Fix any errors that occur, or if no errors occur, then review the results at http://localhost:4000.</li>
<li>Publish: When satisfied with your content, publish it using the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/scripts/blob/master/morea-publish.sh">morea-publish.sh</a> script.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Edit phase</h2>

<p>Just edit the files using any programming text editor (vi, emacs, sublime, etc.) Don&#39;t use
a word processor such as Word.</p>

<h2>Compile phase</h2>

<p>The morea-run-local script invokes the Jekyll compiler in &quot;watch&quot; mode, which means it will automatically
recompile the markdown files whenever it notices that they have been edited. So, for example, this is what happens
when morea-run-local is invoked in the basic-template system:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[~/projecthosting/github/morea-framework/basic-template]-&gt; ./morea-run-local.sh

<p>This normal output shows the markdown files found by Morea, followed by any &quot;warnings&quot; (non-fatal issues) discovered during
processing of the markdown, followed by a summary of processing. At the very end, it indicates that the server
is running and that you can retrieve the site at http://localhost:4000.</p>

<p>If you edit the content associated with a file and save it out, then the compiler will be automatically invoked
and you will see more output appear similar to the above.  If you decide to install a browser
plugin like <a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a>, then the browser page displaying your output will be
refreshed automatically each time you save your source files.  This is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s see what happens when we make an error creating our content. For example, let&#39;s put a typo into
the Foo module definition file so that we reference &quot;outcome12&quot; rather than &quot;outcome1&quot;. Here&#39;s what results:</p>

<p>Instead of &quot;0 errors, 7 warnings&quot;, the compiler reports &quot;1 errors, 7 warnings&quot; and exits back to the

you&#39;ll find:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">  Error: module.md references undefined morea_id: outcome12

<p>This should typically run without errors. If there are errors, use manual git commands to resolve them.</p>

<h2>Equation support</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> is a popular package for rendering LaTeX-style equations in HTML.  Morea provides built-in support for MathJax, so that you can write LaTeX equations in your Markdown files and have it render appropriately.</p>

<p>Here is a screen image illustrating this support:</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid gray" src="images/morea-2.0/mathjax.png" class="img-responsive"></p>

<h2>Overview files</h2>

<p>Morea allows the instructor to define &quot;overview files&quot; whose content is inserted at the top of the six standard pages (Prerequisites, Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, Assessments).</p>

<p>Example overview files are available <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/sample-morea-directory/tree/master/morea">here</a>.</p>

<p>One use case occurs when the instructor wants to provide course-level outcomes in the site. One reasonable place for this information is at the top of the &quot;Outcomes&quot; page, followed by the module-level outcomes.  Here is an example:</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid gray" src="images/morea-2.0/overview-files.png" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p>In other cases, the overview file can simply provide documentation on the contents of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Sample overview markdown file contents</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>

<p><strong>Overview body text</strong></p>

<p>The body of the overview file will be placed at the beginning of its associated page.</p>

<h2>NavBar configuration</h2>

<p>The six standard menu items can be enabled or disabled through the top-level _config.yml file.  Here is an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">name</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Review ICS 311</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">exclude</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">morea</span><span class="p-Indicator">]</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">morea_theme</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">cerulean</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">morea_navbar_items</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>

  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Modules</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Outcomes</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Readings</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Experiences</span>
  <span class="c1"># - Schedule</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, the site has enabled five of the standard nav bar items (Prerequisites, Modules, Outcomes, Readings, and Experiences), but has commented out the Schedule nav bar item and thus it will not be displayed.</p>

<h2>Linking within Morea</h2>

<p>You may wish to reference one Morea page from another.  For example, you might want to link to one Readings page from another Readings page, or to an Experience from an Assessment.</p>

<p>Linking in Morea is complicated by the fact that Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments are implemented in different ways. Modules, Readings, and Experiences are implemented as standalone pages, while Outcomes and Assessments are implemented as page &quot;fragments&quot; that are integrated into other pages.  </p>

<p>A second complication is the fact that the URL required to show the page locally is slightly different from the URL required to show the page when published: a parameter called &quot;site.baseurl&quot; is needed to be included in the URL.</p>

<p>A third complication is that some files (readings, experiences) are located within a morea/ subdirectory, while others (modules, outcomes, and assessments) are not.</p>

<p>The following table documents the structure of absolute links to each of the five Morea entity types:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-bordered">
<tr><th>Entity type</th><th>Link syntax</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Module</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/modules/&lt;module ID&gt;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Outcome</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/outcomes/#&lt;outcome ID&gt;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Reading</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl}}/morea/&lt;path-to-reading-file&gt;/&lt;reading file name&gt;.html</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Experience</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/morea/&lt;path-to-experience-file&gt;/&lt;experience file name&gt;.html</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Assessment</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/assessments/#&lt;assessment ID&gt;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say you have created a module with morea_id &quot;foo&quot; in a directory called &quot;01.foo/&quot; that contains files module.md, outcome.md (with morea_id outcome-foo), reading.md, experience.md, and assessment.md (with morea_id assessment-foo).  Here is how you would create absolute links to each of these entities:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-bordered">
<tr><th>File</th><th>Link</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>module.md</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/modules/foo</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>outcome.md</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/outcomes/#outcome-foo</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>reading.md</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/morea/01.foo/reading.html</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>experience.md</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl }}/morea/01.foo/experience.html</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>assessment.md</td>
<td>{{ site.baseurl}}/assessments/#assessment-foo</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>You will typically use Markdown syntax, so an actual link might look like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[Readings about Foo]({{ site.baseurl }}/morea/01.foo/reading.html)
</code></pre></div>
<p>There is a shortcut that you can use when linking between reading and experience files that are located in the same directory. In this case, you can use a relative link:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[the readings for this experience](reading.html)
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Formatted code options</h2>

<h3>Jekyll highlight tag</h3>

<p>To put code into your pages, one option is to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting">Jekyll code snippet highlighting</a>.</p>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre>
{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String args[]) {
  System.out.println("Hello world");
}
{% endhighlight %}
</pre>

<p>produces:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">[])</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to include syntax.css in your page, or else the code won&#39;t be shown with colors. </p>

<h3>Jekyll gist tag</h3>

<p>For larger code samples, you might prefer to use the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#gist">Jekyll gist tag</a>. </p>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre>
{% gist philipmjohnson/5288814 %}
</pre>

<p>produces:</p>

<p>true<script src="https://gist.github.com/philipmjohnson/5288814.js"> </script></p>

<h3>Code repo</h3>

<p>For documenting executable systems, as opposed to code samples, your best bet is to create a GitHub repo containing the system and provide links to it 
in your markdown.</p>

<h2>Schedule page</h2>

<p>The Module, Reading, and Experience entity types support the <code>morea_start_date</code> and <code>morea_end_date</code> parameters in their Front Matter.   This information is read when the files are processed, and used to generate a page containing a calendar that displays these dates and durations.  For example:</p>

<p><img src="images/morea-2.0/schedule.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>Clicking on one of these events in a live calendar will take you to the corresponding Module, Reading, or Experience definition page.</p>

<p>In order to display a link to this Schedule page in the NavBar, you must edit your _config.yml file and uncomment the Schedule entry in morea_navbar_items:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">morea_navbar_items</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="c1">#- Prerequisites</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Modules</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Outcomes</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Readings</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Experiences</span>
  <span class="c1">#- Assessments</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Schedule</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that whenever you modify _config.yml, you must re-run morea_run_local.sh to see the change.</p>

<h2>Include files and charts</h2>

<p>Jekyll allows you to create small page fragments that you can include in multiple places on your site using the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes">include file syntax</a>. Include files can be passed parameters, which enables a simple kind of macro language that you can use to simplify your Morea content.</p>

<p>The ICS 314 site illustrates the use of include files through its implementation of assessments.  To show how, here is part of its assessments page:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics314-assessments.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>The <a href="http://philipmjohnson.github.io/ics314f13/assessments/">ICS 314 assessments page</a> contains approximately 40 assessments, where each assessment has a chart on the left side and some explanatory text on the right side.  The implementation of this capability involves several steps:</p>

<p>First, the ICS 314 master branch contains a copy of <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">ChartJS</a> in a <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics314f13/tree/master/src/js">js/ directory</a>.  ChartJS is an open source Javascript charting library. </p>

<p>Second, the ICS 314 master branch contains a directory called <code>_includes/</code> containing the file <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics314f13/blob/master/src/_includes/assessment-chartjs.html">assessment-chartjs.html</a>.  Let&#39;s look at this file in more detail:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;script</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/js/Chart.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;row&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;col-sm-6&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;well&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;canvas</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ page.morea_id }}&quot;</span> <span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
     <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;col-sm-6&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    {{ page.morea_chartjs_caption | markdownify }}
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>

    var moreaChartData = {
      labels: {{ page.morea_chartjs_labels }},
      datasets: [ { data: {{ page.morea_chartjs_data }} } ]
    };

    var moreaChartOptions = {
      scaleGridLineColor: &quot;gray&quot;,
      scaleFontColor: &quot;darkgray&quot;,
      scaleLineColor: &quot;darkgray&quot;,
      responsive: true,
      animation: false
    };

    // Get the context of the canvas element we want to select
    var ctx = document.getElementById(&quot;{{ page.morea_id}}&quot;).getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);
    var myNewChart = new Chart(ctx).Bar(moreaChartData, moreaChartOptions);

  <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This include file begins by loading the Chart.js system.  Then it uses Twitter Bootstrap classes to create a single row containing two equal width columms.  The left side contains a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element where the chart is displayed, and the right side contains a textual explanation for the chart. The file references several parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>page.morea_id</code> is a parameter containing the id for the canvas element, and passed to ChartJS to identify where to draw the chart;</li>
<li><code>page.morea_chartjs_caption</code> is a parameter containing the textual explanation to be displayed beside the chart;</li>
<li><code>page.morea_chartjs_labels</code> is a parameter containing an array of strings displayed on the X-axis of the chart;</li>
<li><code>page.morea_chartjs_data</code> is a parameter containing an array of integers indicating the bar height.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s now look at <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics314f13/blob/master/src/morea/010.introduction/assessment-environment-configuration.md">assessment-environment-configuration.md</a>, one of the 40 assessments that invokes this include file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;Environment</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">configuration&quot;</span>

 <span class="no">This assessment verified that students obtained laptops with the appropriate hardware, had the</span>
 <span class="no">appropriate operating system installed, and had successfully installed the appropriate version of Java. </span>

 <span class="no">Discussion:</span>

   <span class="no">* Almost all students complied with requirements. Those who didn&#39;t had inappropriate hardware.</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="p-Indicator">{</span><span class="err">%</span>  <span class="nv">include assessment-chartjs.html  %</span><span class="p-Indicator">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The include file parameters are defined and given values in the YAML front matter section.</li>
<li>The body of the file contains only the <code>include</code> statement. </li>
<li>Front matter variables must be prefaced by &quot;page.&quot; in the include file (so the front matter <code>morea_id</code> is referenced in the include file as <code>{{ page.morea_id }}</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this example illustrates, include files can greatly simplify your Morea content.  In this case, the include file contains all of the Twitter Bootstrap markup, as well as the ChartJS scripts.   The actual assessment file contains only the content specific to that assessment.  This separation of concerns makes it possible to change the layout or change the Chart in a single file and have all of the assessments instances updated as a result.</p>

<h2>Embedding slides</h2>

<p>Rather than include a link to a .ppt or .pdf file, you might find it more user-friendly to embed your slides in a page. The easiest way to do this is by using a cloud-based presentation hosting service, such as <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a>.  In the following example, we will use a similar service, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/">Speaker Deck</a>, which provides a responsive HTML5 embedded player. If you prefer SlideShare, the same general procedure will work.</p>

<p>First, create a Speaker Deck account by going to the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/signup">Speaker Deck signup page</a>. You can use your GitHub account to simplify signup.</p>

<p>Second, upload your slides.  The upload file must be PDF, so you must export your slides in that format.  Note the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/faq#size_limit">size limit</a>. Once uploaded, you will have a page like the following for your presentation:</p>

<p><img src="images/speakerdeck-page.png" width="700px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>Third, add the embed code to your Morea page. To do this, notice the &quot;Embed&quot; button on the right side of the page displayed above.  Clicking this button will pop up a dialog box with the HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element you must place in your Morea page to embed this  presentation.  For example, here is what a readings page might look like with the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> code</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;Lecture</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Notes:</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Sequential</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Warmup&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">## Lecture Notes: Sequential Warmup</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">&lt;script async class=&quot;speakerdeck-embed&quot; data-id=&quot;ef27d6f0f33001316dfc66ebab3e7b80&quot; data-ratio=&quot;1.33333333333333&quot; src=&quot;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That&#39;s it!   Here is what this Readings page looks like:</p>

<p><img src="images/speakerdeck-morea.png" width="700px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>The embedded image is responsive, so it works nicely on a mobile device.  Your students can study on the bus:</p>

<p><img src="images/speakerdeck-mobile.png" width="400px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p> A somewhat simpler approach is to host the slides pdfs with the other materials and use an &lt;embed&gt; html element, e.g.,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">
<span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="c1">## Lecture Notes: Sequential Warmup</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">&lt;embed src=&quot;./lecture.pdf&quot; type='application/pdf'&gt;</span>
</code></pre></figure>

<h2>Google analytics</h2>

<p>If you are interesting in tracking usage of your pages, Morea supports <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>.  </p>

<p>To use, first read the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3544906">Google Analytics Get Started</a> and set up an account and tracking ID.  </p>

<p>Then, edit your _config.yml file to provide the tracking ID. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">name: Review ICS 241
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  input: GFM
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
mathjax: true
baseurl: /ReviewICS241
exclude: [morea]
morea_theme: cerulean
morea_navbar_items:
  - Prerequisites
  - Modules
  - Outcomes
  - Readings
  - Experiences
morea_google_analytics_tracking_id: &quot;UA-64069138-1&quot;
morea_course: ics241
morea_domain: http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/
</code></pre></div>
<h1>Themes</h1>

<p>Because variety is the spice of life, Morea provides a set of pre-built themes that you can use to modify the look (colors and fonts) for your site.  These themes are based upon the <a href="http://bootswatch.com">Bootswatch</a> themes for Bootstrap. </p>

<p>To select a theme for your site, edit the morea_theme parameter in the _config.yml file in the src/ directory of your site:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">morea_theme: cerulean
</code></pre></div>
<p>The default value (i.e. the value that comes with the basic-template) is &quot;cerulean&quot;.  The theme in use appears in the footer area of your site.  After changing the value of the theme, you must restart Jekyll (i.e. control-c and re-invoke morea-run-local.sh) to see the change.</p>

<p>It is possible to modify these themes or define new ones of your own.  This process will be documented in the developer guide later.</p>

<p>The following sections show a sample page for each of the pre-installed themes in alphabetical order. Click image to see full-size.</p>

<h1>Scripts</h1>

<p>Because Morea development involves the management of two branches (master, gh-pages) of your repo, we provide a set of Unix/Mac scripts to simplify various development actions.  These scripts are maintained in the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/scripts">morea-framework/scripts</a> repository.  </p>

<p>All of these scripts run from the top-level directory of your local Morea site (in other words, the directory containing the master/ and gh-pages/ subdirectories).  </p>

<p>After downloading the scripts, you must make them executable by running the <code>chmod</code> command. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% chmod 775 morea-publish.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once they are made executable, you can invoke them. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-publish.sh &quot;Added module on Java&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is an overview of the scripts we currently provide.</p>

<h2>morea-vanilla-install</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-vanilla-install.sh">morea-vanilla-install.sh</a> script implements the recommended approach to setting up a Morea site which does not require forking.  To use this script:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new, empty repo on GitHub using the browser-based mechanisms. </li>
<li>Create a new, empty local directory in which you will develop your site. </li>
<li>Download the morea-vanilla-install.sh script and set its permissions using <code>chmod 755 morea-vanilla-install.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Invoke the morea-vanilla-install.sh script. </li>
</ul>

<p>This script requires two arguments: your github account and your new repo to initialize. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-vanilla-install.sh philipmjohnson ics314f13
</code></pre></div>
<p>The script performs the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creates master/ and gh-pages directories.</li>
<li>Clones the master branch of your repo into the master/ directory.</li>
<li>Creates a new, orphan gh-pages branch of your repo and checks out that branch into the gh-pages/ directory.</li>
<li>Sets &#39;upstream&#39; to the core repo.</li>
<li>Merges the upstream branch into your new master branch in the master/ directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>When completed, your master/ branch should contain a copy of the core repo.  If you encounter merge conflicts during the execution of this script, you will need to fix the files in the master/ directory, and recommit them.  Some helpful documentation is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line">resolving a merge conflict from the command line</a>. </p>

<p>It is a good idea after running morea-vanilla-install to run morea-run-local.sh to see that the new site can be created successfully, then morea-publish.sh to commit your initialized site to your GitHub repo.</p>

<h2>morea-merge-upstream</h2>

<p>The Morea Framework is still under active development, and the changes and improvements are generally reflected in updates to the basic-template system.   </p>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-merge-upstream.sh">morea-merge-upstream.sh</a> script incorporates updates to the core system into your local site.  The script defines the core repo as an &quot;upstream&quot; repo, then fetches and merges changes in the master branch of core into your local repo. </p>

<p>This script requires no arguments.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-merge-upstream.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>In some cases merge conflicts can result from this merge.  Don&#39;t worry, they are generally very easy to resolve. The <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/">GitHub documentation on merge conflicts</a> probably provides everything you need to know. If you&#39;re still confused, contact the Morea developers for help.</p>

<h2>morea-publish</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-publish.sh">morea-publish.sh</a> script pushes your local version of your Morea site to GitHub so that it will now be publicly accessable at <code>http://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>It does this by first running Jekyll over your source files, placing the generated HTML into your gh-pages subdirectory, then commiting this branch and the master branch to your GitHub repo.  </p>

<p>This script requires a string containing the commit message. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-publish.sh &quot;Adding the Intro to CSS module.&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<h2>morea-pull</h2>

<p>The default workflow when working in a team is for each member to commit their changes to the master and gh-pages branches of the GitHub repository as they complete enhancements. Thus, when starting a work session, you will want to first perform a <code>git pull</code> to update your local repository on your laptop to the latest version available on GitHub. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-pull.sh">morea-pull.sh</a> script simply performs a <code>git pull</code> in both the master/ and gh-pages/ subdirectories so that they contain the latest version available from GitHub.</p>

<p>This script requires no arguments.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-pull.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>If merge errors occur, you will need to resolve them. Contact the Morea framework development team if you need assistance with this process.</p>

<h2>morea-run-local</h2>

<p>When doing development, it is convenient to be able to review your work in a browser without publishing the changes to GitHub.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-run-local.sh">morea-run-local.sh</a> script runs the Jekyll compiler and displays the results at <code>http://localhost:4000</code>.</p>

<p>This script requires no arguments.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-run-local.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>We recommend that you install a browser plugin such as <a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a>, which will automatically refresh your browser page when changes are detected to underlying directory files.   Using LiveReload in combination with morea-run-local results in your browser instantly reflecting the changes to your source files as soon as you save them.  This makes Morea site development significantly more fluid and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Note that when you make changes to your source file, you must stop the morea-run-local.sh script with control-c and restart it in order to see the changes rendered into HTML.  (For those familiar with Jekyll: the --watch command will not work in Morea because the directory in which most work is done (/morea), is ignored by the Jekyll run-time for the purposes of auto-recompilation.  See the next script, morea-watch, for a workaround.)</p>

<h2>morea-watch</h2>

<p>One of the downsides of morea-run-local is that when you make changes to your source files, you must manually stop and restart the morea-run-local script.</p>

<p>To address this usability problem, the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-watch.rb">morea-watch.rb</a> script is a wrapper around morea-run-local which monitors the state of your morea/ directory and when it detects changes, will kill the Jekyll server process and restart it automatically.</p>

<p>To use it, just invoke morea-watch.rb instead of morea-run-local.sh.</p>

<p>Note: morea-watch.rb does not currently work on Windows.</p>

<h2>morea-install</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-install.sh">morea-install.sh</a> script downloads a GitHub repository containing a previously initialized Morea site.  It assumes that the GitHub repo contains both a master and gh-pages branch.</p>

<p>This script requires two arguments: a github user and the Morea site repo to download. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% ./morea-install.sh philipmjohnson ics314f13
</code></pre></div>
<h2>morea-module-status</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/scripts/master/morea-module-status.py">morea-module-status.py</a> script provides a way to globally inspect and change the &quot;visibility&quot; of modules. Running the script brings up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> user interface for automagically updating the &quot;published&quot;, &quot;morea_coming_soon&quot;, and &quot;morea_highlighted&quot; parameters in a module definition file:</p>

<p><img src="images/morea-module-publishing.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>The morea-module-status UI is an homage to the days when programmers had the Right Stuff and the focus was on getting the job done with 6K RAM, not on fancy-pants bells and whistles like &quot;reactive&quot; or &quot;responsive&quot; UIs.</p>

<h1>Beyond Morea</h1>

<p>As the name implies, &quot;Morea&quot; provides you with mechanisms to define modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and  assessments. </p>

<p>However, most course web sites need to also provide other kinds information to students. For example, many instructors want a top-level &quot;Schedule&quot; page containing a calendar showing due dates and other class events.  Others may wish to have a &quot;News&quot; page containing announcements.  Still others may wish to store exams and other course data files in their
 site. This chapter provides documentation on how to enhance your Morea site with all of these other kinds of information.</p>

<p>To effectively go &quot;beyond Morea&quot;, you need to have a basic conceptual understanding of the organization of your repository and the locus of control for the three fundamental tools: GitHub, Jekyll, and Morea.   This organization is illustrated by the following graphic, which shows the master branch of the basic-template repository:</p>

<p><img src="images/beyond-morea.png" width="400px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>This graphic shows that a Morea site is organized like an onion with three layers, each &quot;managed&quot; by a different combination of tools.</p>

<p><strong>Morea managed.</strong> In the center is the &quot;Morea layer&quot;, which consists of all the files in the <code>morea/</code> directory.  It is here where you define the modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments for your course. There is a Morea plugin to Jekyll that looks for the contents of this directory and parses all the files inside to create the Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments pages. </p>

<p><strong>Jekyll managed.</strong> However, Morea is also just a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static website which builds a site based upon the contents of the <code>src/</code> directory.  As a result, you can customize your site by making any valid Jekyll enhancements in this directory.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub managed.</strong> If we go up one more level of abstraction, your Morea site is just a GitHub-managed repository. The outermost level, above the <code>src/</code> directory, contains files and directories that are not touched by Jekyll but are still part of your repository.  You can put files or directories here that you do not want to be processed by Jekyll but that you wish to be associated with the course. </p>

<p>Up to now in this User Guide, we&#39;ve focused almost exclusively on the contents of the <code>morea/</code> directory.  In this section, we&#39;ll now start making enhancements outside this directory in order to leverage additional capabilities of Jekyll and GitHub. </p>

<h2>Add a menu item</h2>

<p>One of the most simple enhancements you can make to a basic Morea site is to add a new link to the navbar. To accomplish this, simply edit the navbar definition code found in your <code>master/src/_layouts/default.html</code> file.  For example, here is an enhanced version of the navbar code within the default.html file with a link to a Google Group:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;collapse navbar-collapse&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;nav navbar-nav&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Home<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/modules/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Modules<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/outcomes/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Outcomes<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/readings/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Readings<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/experiences/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Experiences<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assessments/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Assessments<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ics314f13&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Discussion<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Essentially, you just add a new <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag containing your link.</p>

<h2>Add a dropdown menu</h2>

<p>An equally easy enhancement is a dropdown menu containing a list of links. Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-dropdown.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>As before, you edit the navbar code in your default.html file, this time with the Twitter Bootstrap dropdown menu code. Here is the section implementing the dropdown menu from the above screenshot:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;li</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;dropdown&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;dropdown-toggle&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-toggle=</span><span class="s">&quot;dropdown&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;#&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Course Info<span class="nt">&lt;b</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;caret&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;dropdown-menu&quot;</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">&quot;menu&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/morea/010.introduction/reading-course-info.html&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Overview<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/morea/010.introduction/reading-policies.html&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Policies<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/morea/010.introduction/reading-topic-overview.html&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Topics<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You&#39;ll need to edit this code by replacing the contents of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements with your own links.</p>

<p>See the above code in context <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics311s14/blob/master/src/_layouts/default.html#l38-45">here</a>.                                     </p>

<p>Learn more about this syntax using the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns">Twitter Bootstrap dropdown menu documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Add a Schedule page</h2>

<p>A common desire for a course website is a navbar element containing a link to a page containing a calendar of events. There are at least three approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use just <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a>.  Google Calendar is free and highly functional.  By defining a Google Calendar to hold your course events and schedule, students can easily import your calendar into their own Calendar app (Google&#39;s, Apple&#39;s, or a third party) and receive notifications when events occur.  The downside with Google Calendar is that to display it in your course site, the only Google-supplied option is an embedded calendar, which doesn&#39;t look great.</p></li>
<li><p>Use just a third-party Javascript Library such as <a href="http://fullcalendar.io/">Full Calendar</a>.  These libraries produce nicely formatted calendars, but used alone you have to manually add events using their local data structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine Google Calendar with Full Calendar.  The best of both worlds!  This is the approach documented in this section.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here&#39;s the <a href="http://philipmjohnson.github.io/ics314f13/schedule/">ICS 314 Schedule Page</a>:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics314-schedule-page.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.  Create your Google Calendar.</strong>  Using the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar application</a>, create a new calendar to hold the events associated with your course.  Create a test event for today so that something shows up when you display the calendar for testing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2. Create a Google API key.</strong>  See the <a href="http://fullcalendar.io/docs/google_calendar/">FullCalendar Google Calendar API key documentation</a> for the steps you need to take to do this.  For the referrers field, a good approach is to restrict the websites to your github.io sites.  For example, if your github username is &#39;philipmjohnson&#39;, then the referrers field should be: &#39;philipmjohnson.github.io/*&#39;.  That means that you can use the same API key for all your Morea sites, and also that others can&#39;t use your API key.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3. Create the schedule page files.</strong>    In the <code>src/</code> directory, create a new subdirectory called <code>schedule/</code> containing an <code>index.html</code> page.</p>

<p><img src="images/schedule-directory.png" width="300px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>You can copy the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics314f13/blob/master/src/schedule/index.html">ICS314 schedule/index.html</a> to use as a template. Here is a snapshot of the code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">---
layout: default
title: Schedule
---

<span class="c">&lt;!-- Load FullCalendar for schedule page. --&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- Documentation available at: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/google_calendar/ --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullcalendar/2.2.2/fullcalendar.css&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.8.4/moment.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullcalendar/2.2.2/fullcalendar.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullcalendar/2.2.2/gcal.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;margin-bottom: 10px&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Schedule<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

   <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>The schedule for this course is managed using the public Google Calendar displayed on this page. You can subscribe to this calendar using its <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/ovc7gbat5jfpb6kg0a14ur12qg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>iCal address<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&#39;calendar&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
  $(document).ready(function () {

    // page is now ready, initialize the calendar...

    $(&#39;#calendar&#39;).fullCalendar({
      googleCalendarApiKey: &#39;AIzaSyBTwmlnN3BzIterDVli-CyHBxqV8gjWj3U&#39;,
      eventColor: &#39;#3399f3&#39;,
      events: {
        googleCalendarId: &#39;m7nms0v3ud99ucgtn8lopo79sk@group.calendar.google.com&#39;
      }
    });

    $(&#39;#calendar&#39;).fullCalendar(&#39;gotoDate&#39;, &#39;2013-08-01&#39;);
  });
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You will need to modify this code in a few places to display your own calendar appropriately:</p>

<p>First, replace the iCal address with your calendar&#39;s iCal address.  Providing this link enables students to view this calendar from within their own calendar applications. You can find the iCal address on the settings page for your course&#39;s Google Calendar. The address link typically ends with &quot;basic.ics&quot;.</p>

<p>Second, replace my googleCalendarApiKey by your Google API key. (Mine won&#39;t work for your sites.)</p>

<p>Third, modify the googleCalendarId to the calendar ID for your calendar.  This is found on the settings page for your course&#39;s Google Calendar.  It typically has the suffix &#39;group.calendar.google.com&#39;.</p>

<p>Fourth, you may want to change the &quot;eventColor&quot; parameter value to be more compatible with your theme.</p>

<p>Finally, you will probably want to delete the line containing the &#39;gotoDate&#39; command so that your calendar defaults to displaying the current month.   But this code also shows how you can make the calendar default to displaying a month of your choosing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4. Extend the navbar with a link to this page.</strong> Once you&#39;ve created the <code>index.html</code> file, you will want to add a link to this page to the navbar.  The navbar code is available in your <code>master/src/_layouts/default.html</code> file. For example, here is the <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics314f13/blob/master/src/_layouts/default.html#l52">ICS 314 schedule navbar code</a>.  Essentially, all you need to do is add a single line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/&quot;&gt;Schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Step 5. Test your calendar.</strong>  Now commit your changes to GitHub, and retrieve your site&#39;s Schedule page from the GitHub site.  You should see your calendar and the test event.  Note that calendar events will not be displayed when you run the site locally. They will only display once you publish your site on GitHub and display the page there.</p>

<h2>Add a News page</h2>

<p>Another common desire is a page containing news and announcements.  For this feature, we can exploit Jekyll&#39;s built-in blogging support.   We will write each news item following the conventions for a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">Jekyll blog post</a>, then create a page that displays these posts using the Morea look-and-feel. For example, here is the <a href="http://philipmjohnson.github.io/ics311s14/news/">ICS 311 News Page</a>:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-news-page.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>Adding this feature to your own site requires the following steps: create one or more news items, create the page to display them, add a link to this page to your navbar, and update your <code>_config.yml</code> file so RSS feeds work correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1. Write some example news items.</strong> To start, you should write a couple of sample Jekyll blog posts representing course news items. This means updating the <code>_posts</code> directory with your news items.  For example, here is what the ICS 311 <code>_posts</code> directory looks like:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-posts-directory.png" width="300px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>Here is an example of one news item in Jekyll blog posting format:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">layout</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">post</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>  <span class="s">&quot;Extra</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">credit&quot;</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">date</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>   <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">2014-02-01 14:29:39</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Due to fact that the grading workload is already too great for the TA time allocated, we will not have extra credit programming or problem solving assignments. Extra credit will be built in to the three projects and some of the homework assignments. So, don&#39;t slack</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">you won&#39;t be given other opportunities to earn credit!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 2. Add a page to display your news items.</strong> Now that you have some sample news items, you should create the page that displays them.  There are many ways to format news items, and you can do it whatever way you want, but the following instructions show how to duplicate the format illustrated above for the ICS 311 site.</p>

<p>First, create a new directory called <code>news/</code>, and add an <code>index.html</code> file within it with the following contents:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">---
layout: default
title: News
---

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>News<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>(Note: if you use a news reader, you can subscribe to these announcements using this <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ &quot;</span><span class="err">/feed.xml&quot;</span> <span class="err">|</span> <span class="err">prepend:</span> <span class="err">site.baseurl</span> <span class="err">}}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>feed<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>)<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

{% for post in site.posts %}
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;{% cycle &#39;section-background-1&#39;, &#39;section-background-2&#39; %}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h4&gt;</span>{{ post.title }} <span class="nt">&lt;small&gt;</span>{{ post.date | date: &quot;%b %-d, %Y&quot;  }}<span class="nt">&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
    {{ post.content }}
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
{% endfor %}</code></pre></figure>

<p>This code in context is available <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics311s14/blob/master/src/news/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3. Update your navbar with a link to your news page.</strong>  This is easy. Add the following fragment to your default.html file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/news/&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This code in context is available <a href="https://github.com/philipmjohnson/ics311s14/blob/master/src/_layouts/default.html#l59">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4. Update <code>_config.yml</code> file with a url parameter.</strong> The final step is to add a url parameter to your <code>_config.yml</code> file so that that <code>site.url</code> variable can be referenced correctly in the feed.xml file.  Here&#39;s an example line:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">url</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">http://henricasanova.github.io/ics632_fall2014</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that there&#39;s no ending slash. </p>

<h2>Non-Morea markdown files</h2>

<p>In certain situations, you may wish to have a markdown file within your module&#39;s directory that is not listed as an outcome, reading, experience, or assessment.  A common example is a quiz page. Of course, you could create a directory called <code>quizzes/</code> outside the <code>morea/</code> directory and put the quiz files there, but then they would not be in the same directory as the module.</p>

<p>To support this situation, Morea processes markdown files in different ways depending upon their extension.  If the extension is <code>.md</code>, then the file is processed as a Morea file and various YAML parameters are required (such as morea_id).</p>

<p>If the extension is <code>.markdown</code>, the file is processed as a regular Jekyll file and converted to HTML.  This allows you to create markdown files in a module directory that are not modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, or assessments. </p>

<p>Here is an example from the ICS 311 site:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-quiz.png" width="600px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>The actual page is available <a href="http://philipmjohnson.github.io/ics311s14/morea/080.binary-search-trees/quiz-binaries.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a portion of the source page to illustrate how it was created:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;Quiz:</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Binary</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">search</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">tree&quot;</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">topdiv</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">container</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="c1"># Quiz: Binary Search Trees</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Show that if a node in a binary search tree has two children, then its successor Y has no left child and its predecessor has no right child. (_The proofs are symmetric. Hints</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Rule out where the successor cannot be to narrow down to where it must be. Draw Pictures!!!_)</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>This code in context is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipmjohnson/ics311s14/master/src/morea/080.binary-search-trees/quiz-binaries.markdown">here</a>.</p>

<p>When creating these pages, please be aware of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>To have the page appear with the site header and footer, include the YAML front matter <code>layout: default</code>. </li>
<li>To provide the standard left and right margins, include the YAML front matter <code>topdiv: container</code>.</li>
<li>The HTML page is generated in the same directory path as the path where the source file is located. </li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly, if you are using this mechanism to create quizzes, be sure to make your repository private so that students do not have access to the source file for the quiz. In addition, the file should be named something that is not easily guessed by students (i.e. &quot;security through obscurity&quot;).</p>

<h2>Add private data</h2>

<p>In many cases, you might want to keep files in your repository that are not made a part of the published website.  There are two ways to do that: either inside or outside the <code>morea/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>The <code>_ignore</code> directory</h3>

<p>The Morea processor ignores any directories inside the <code>morea/</code> directory that are named <code>_ignore</code>.  So, if you 
create a directory called <code>java/</code> to hold the contents of the Java module, and then put a subdirectory inside <code>java/</code> called <code>_ignore</code>, the contents of that directory will not appear in the published site.  This is a nice way to keep tests associated with a module but not make them available on the site.</p>

<h3>Go outside <code>src/</code></h3>

<p>A second way manage private data is to create a directory outside the <code>src/</code> directory, named something like <code>private/</code>, and place your private files inside that directory. All files and directories outside the <code>src/</code> directory will not be touched by Jekyll or Morea.</p>

<p>For example, the following screenshot shows a <code>private/</code> directory in the ICS 311 master branch containing a file called <code>midterm.doc</code>:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-private.png" width="300px" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>Since this <code>private/</code> directory occurs outside the <code>src/</code> directory, Jekyll will leave this directory unprocessed and its contents will not appear in the (public) gh-pages branch of your repository. </p>

<p>Note that if you do not want the public (i.e. your students) to be able to access this directory in the master branch, you must make your repository private!</p>
